enter to gitlab 
here we have different options:
create a project 
create a group
explore public projects
first we select -> create a project > import project 
next we give permission to the app for our git repository and then we can see the different repositories and hit import button on the
respository desired. now we open the project selected and hit setup ci/cd


Concepts:
 a pipeline is composed of independent jobs that runs scripts, grouped into stages
 stages run in sequential order, but jobs within stages run in parallel.
 jobs: set of commands group together to execute an actions, for example.

 unit-test-job:   # This job runs in the test stage.
  stage: test    # It only starts when the job in the build stage completes successfully.
  script:
    - echo "Running unit tests... This will take about 60 seconds."
    - sleep 60
    - echo "Code coverage is 90%"

lint-test-job:   # This job also runs in the test stage.
  stage: test    # It can run at the same time as unit-test-job (in parallel).
  script:
    - echo "Linting code... This will take about 10 seconds."
    - sleep 10
    - echo "No lint issues found."

ABOVE we have two job that execute actions in that case they belong to the same stage so they run in parallel.

once we are here we modify yaml file, for instance this way that is showed below:
stages:
  - test

test-job:
    stage: test
    script:
        - npm ci
        - npm run test

and lastly, we can commit the changes and the pipeline will run
